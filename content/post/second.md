Reduce your attack surface by isolating your blockchain applications from direct HSM access to protect against key exposure and fund theft even if your blockchain application is fully rooted by attackers.

<i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> safeSig <.io> KeyGuardAPI reduces the attack surface for many types of attacks:

<i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i> Chosen-PlainText Attacks

<i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i> Side-Channel Attacks*

<i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i> Key Dumps

<i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i> Malicious Transaction Signing


Restrict and sanitize cryptocurrency signature and other key operation requests to your private keys with safeSig <.io> Cryptocurrency DMI Technology powering KeyGuardAPI.

Authorize and bind your private keys to sign specific cryptocurrency data messages:

<i class="far fa-handshake"></i> `Transactions [Amount, Origin, Destination, Time, scriptSigs, 2FA]`

<i class="fas fa-cube"></i> `Blocks [Timestamp, Transactions, BlockReward, Version, Network]`
